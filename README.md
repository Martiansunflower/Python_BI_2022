### NumPy 
*This code is a set of functions for matrix operations implemented using the NumPy library.* \
\
**matrix_multiplication** is the name of a practical exercise for creating arrays. \
**multiplication_check** is a function to check whether the entered arrays can be multiplied in the order they are entered or not. Two arrays should be set as an input. \
**multiply_matrices** is a function for multiplying the entered arrays, if this operation is possible. Two arrays should be set as an input. \
**compute_2d_distance** is a function for calculating the distance between points with two coordinates. Two arrays with a pair of values should be set as an input.\
**compute_multidimensional_distance** is a function for calculating the distance between points with any number of coordinates. Two arrays with any number of values should be set as an input (but so that the number of values in the first and second arrays is equal). \
**compute_pair_distances** is a function for calculating the matrix of pairwise distances. A two-dimensional matrix should be set as an input.
